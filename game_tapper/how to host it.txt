🌐 How to Host Your Static Game Publicly
The recommended methods involve using services designed specifically for hosting static files.

1. GitHub Pages (Recommended Free Method)
This is one of the easiest and most popular ways to host simple static sites like your game, and it's completely free.

Steps
Create a GitHub Account: If you don't have one, sign up for a free account.

Create a Repository:

Click the "New" button to create a new repository (a project folder).

Give it a name (e.g., key-tapper-game). Make sure it's set to Public.

Upload Your Files:

In the new repository, click the "Add file" dropdown and select "Upload files".

Drag and drop your three files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) into the upload area and commit the changes.

Activate GitHub Pages:

Go to the Settings tab of your repository.

In the sidebar, click on Pages.

Under "Build and deployment," choose Deploy from a branch and select the main branch (or master, depending on your setup) and the / (root) folder.

Click Save.

Share the URL: GitHub will build the site and provide you with a live URL, typically in the format: https://[YourUsername].github.io/[RepositoryName]/ (e.g., https://jane-doe.github.io/key-tapper-game/). Share this link with your friends.

2. Netlify (Fast & Simple)
Netlify is another excellent option known for its user-friendly drag-and-drop deployment.

Steps
Create an Account: Sign up for a free Netlify account.

Drag and Drop:

Go to the Netlify dashboard.

Take your local EnhancedTapperGame folder (the one containing all three files).

Drag the entire folder onto the large dashed rectangle that says, "Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git? Drag and drop your site folder here."

Result: Netlify will instantly deploy your site and give it a random name (e.g., fluffy-liger-12345.netlify.app). You can customize this sub-domain name for a cleaner link.

3. Vercel
Vercel is similar to Netlify, offering extremely fast and reliable static hosting.

Steps
Create an Account: Sign up for a free Vercel account (you can sign up with GitHub).

New Project: Click the "Add New" button and select "Project".

Import (Connect to GitHub): The easiest way is to connect Vercel to your GitHub repository (from Method 1). Vercel will then automatically deploy your game every time you make changes to the code on GitHub.

Share the URL: Vercel will provide a live URL (e.g., key-tapper-game.vercel.app).

All three of these options are suitable for a simple static game and are generally free for personal use. GitHub Pages is often the standard starting point.
